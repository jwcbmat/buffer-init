## Buffer in Node

<Buffer 02 04 06 08 0a 0c 0e 10>

what is this?

The short answer is that in order to save space and be more readable, the implementers of node.js have chosen to display a hexadecimal numbers instead of a binary numbers. What does that mean?

 - When we ordinarily think of number we think of each digit as ranging from 0-9. This is what’s called a decimal number system, or a base-10 number system. But it’s possible to have other number systems, such as binary which is a base-2 number system. Each digit only ranges from 0-1.
 -  Hexadecimal is still another number system, this time each digit ranges from 0-15. Perhaps the easiest way to understand this concept is by looking at a conversion chart:
